#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script is a wrapper for running NextDenovo and NextPolish in a single command.

# Usage:
#   nextdenovo.sh <read_fastq> <assembly_prefix> <threads> <genome_size> [read_type]
#   read_type can be ONT (default). PB_HIFI/hifi support is planned.

# Requirements:
#   NextDenovo: https://github.com/Nextomics/NextDenovo
#   NextPolish: https://github.com/Nextomics/NextPolish
#   (NextPolish2 will be required for hifi reads in the future)
